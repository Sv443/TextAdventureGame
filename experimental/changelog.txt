{ TODO / BUGS >

		NOTE: please send any bugs, errors, glitches or suggestions (please look at the planned features (at the bottom) first to not make a duplicate)
		through the github issue tracker to help improving the game! You'll also be mentioned in the credits :) (https://github.com/Sv443/TextAdventureGame/issues)


		D- (DONE - added load delay to allow for functions to load before getting called) fix bug of modules not loading correctly on a public website (works fine locally via file:///)
		D- (DONE - if statement was formatted weirdly) fix bug of "make" always executing the not enough material to build shelter message
		D- (DONE - put it to the left of changelog arrow) find better position for mute button
		D- (DONE - had to be "else if" but only was "if") fix bug of "what do you want to get?" appearing after coconut was taken
		D- (DONE - also added load delay) fix bug of "the save module was disabled" being shown no matter if it was loaded correctly or not
		D- (DONE - made the script not focus if CTRL and/or ALT are being pressed) make the script not focus on the <input> when CTRL is pressed
		- module count display and init still not loading correctly on external URL (not file:///) (slowly starts to piss me off now) (this bug is not game breaking but it makes the displays not work and sometimes even the prologue messages don't show up at all and it displays the couldn't load script error even though everything works fine)
		D- (DONE - made the background color transparent) graphical error of retry button not having a transparent container
		D- (DONE - resizing underlay after death) graphical error of underlay between in/output elements not resizing correctly after death
		WIP- finally fix the damn submit button scaling issues and its bad design that bugged me since 0.0.1
		- sort the github repo and put all resources in a dedicated folder like the day/night cycle images already are
		D- (DONE - variable was being initialized but didn't get set correctly) mute element not found
		- bad scaling on mobile devices
		- add save/load buttons
		- ui scales and positions incorrectly after death
		- ui shows up (info panel doesn't) after the scene was switched even if it was disabled before
		D- (DONE - added a button to the control panel) make the UI collapsable or maybe even completely togglable to get a "cinematic" view
		D- (DONE - info panel updater which was in an if statement couldn't be reached while the d/n cycle state was 0) 10:00 being displayed instead of 12:00
}
{ PLANNED >
		WIP- change through different scenes (backgrounds) to see your structures, your inventory, your health and status effects, the day/night cycle, settings, and so on
		WIP- unique soundtrack (currently work in progress)
		- multi-language support
		- multiple bad and good endings
		- more discoverable and explorable structures with unique items
		- butterfly-effect
		- completely rework the parser and loading script (very very hard-coded)
		- allow people to make their own text adventure game only through the usage of arrays and variables in a new module (no fiddly coding at all          (except for me            yay                       i'm already excited))
		- add multiple themes for the UI
